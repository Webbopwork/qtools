# QTools
QTools, or QuickTools are a bunch of scripts I made to speed up processes for myself, any now also you!

## Using

To use a QTool with the `qtool` command set up, follow this format:
```
qtool {COMMAND NAME(same as directory in the repo)} {ALL COMMAND ARGUMENTS YOU WISH TO USE}
```

## Setup

To initialise, add in your ~/.bashsrc
```
alias qtool_setup=". <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webbopwork/qtools/refs/heads/main/qtool/setup.sh)"
```
if you wanna not automatically initialise the `qtool` command,

or 
```
. <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webbopwork/qtools/refs/heads/main/qtool/setup.sh)
```
if you wanna automatically initialise the `qtool` command.

The commands work pasted in your terminal too.

Alternatively you can download any script you wish and use it separately.
