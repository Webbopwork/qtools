# DaVinci Resolve installer for Fedora Linux
This program/script solves certain problems with installing DaVinci Resolve using the offical installer, this functions as a correcting aid for that installer.

The program may function on other Linux operating systems too, only tested on Fedora Linux Workstation 42.

## Format
```
qtool resolve-fedora-install "[Path to the .run installer file]"
```

## Example
```
qtool resolve-fedora-install "./DaVinci_Resolve_20.0b4_Linux.run"
```
